# Density and Economy

## Why this file exists

This is the dimension that catches waste rather than breakage. Every other rule in this plugin is a rule against excess: too many buzzwords, too many em
dashes, too much gradient, too many `!important`s, shadows on everything. All of them
describe output doing too much of something.

None of them describes an interface doing too little with what it was given. A page can
pass every rule in `design-patterns.md` and `frontend-patterns.md` and still waste half the
display, take three screens to say what fits on one, and put a button two thousand pixels
from the row it acts on. Nothing overlaps. Nothing clips. Nothing scrolls sideways. Every
check is green and the interface is still bad.

That gap is not hypothetical. It shipped: an admin dashboard cleared eight parallel
specialist reviews and 121 pull-request findings, and then its owner opened it and asked,
in order, why it did not use the window, why there were walls of text, why the pages were
endless with nothing collapsible, and why the buttons were where they were. The
measurements below are from that page.

**A review that only looks for breakage will approve any amount of waste.**

## The rule that makes it actionable

> Waste with no measurement attached is a taste note. With a measurement it is MEDIUM or
> HIGH.

This is the whole discipline, and skipping it is why the pattern went un-actioned for eight
releases in the toolkit it came from: it was listed as an anti-pattern with no number, so
no reviewer could rank a well-rendered page as broken. The severity scale everywhere else
is anchored on breakage -- CRITICAL is "blocks use", HIGH is overlapping controls -- and a
defect that renders perfectly cannot climb that ladder on its own. A reviewer applying it
honestly lands on "taste", which does not survive triage.

Rank waste by **how much of the operator's screen or time it costs**, and carry the number:

- Over a third of the viewport, a page more than twice as long as it needs to be, or an
  action a person cannot associate with its object: **HIGH**.
- A bounded cost, such as a section that should be folded or a paragraph that should be two
  sentences: **MEDIUM**.
- "I would have laid this out differently", with no measurement: **genuinely a taste note**,
  and it belongs in that bucket. That boundary is what keeps the rest credible.

Confidence class: waste with a measurement is a **Quality defect**; without one it is a
**Taste note**. See `confidence-and-evidence.md`.

## Thresholds

Review thresholds, not design law. Each is a finding when exceeded AND the exemption does
not apply.

### Viewport utilisation

Measure at the widest viewport reviewed, and at 1920px. Then measure at the narrowest, per
§ The check that generalises: this rubric had one direction for eight releases, and the
opposite direction is a real failure that a too-little-content threshold cannot catch.

| Condition | Severity |
|---|---|
| Content occupies < 60% of viewport width, with no second column, sidebar, or reading-measure reason | HIGH |
| 60-75% with no justification | MEDIUM |
| Capped at a reading measure (~65-75ch) and the content IS prose | Not a finding. Correct |
| Capped at a reading measure, but the content is tabular or a dashboard | HIGH |
| **Content overflows the viewport at 320-390px**, forcing horizontal scroll on the page (not inside a deliberately scrollable table or code block) | HIGH |
| **A table or control row that cannot fit at 390px** with no stacked, card, or horizontally-scrolled-container fallback | HIGH |
| **A fixed-width child wider than 320px** inside an otherwise fluid shell | MEDIUM |

The prose exception is the whole subtlety. A reading measure is right for an article and
wrong for a table, and the failure above happened because one `--measure` token served
both: a value sized like prose was capping a ledger. When a page holds both, they need
separate measures.

**Centring is not a fix.** Splitting 1008px of dead space into two 504px gutters is the
same waste, symmetrically arranged. If the recommendation for dead space is
`margin-inline: auto`, the finding was misdiagnosed.

**Neither direction's fix is the other direction's cause.** Widening a shell to use the
window must not produce a table that overflows at 390px, and fitting a table at 390px must
not cap it at a reading measure on a 1920px display. Both thresholds are measured on the
same review, and a change that clears one while breaking the other has not been fixed. The
overflow direction is described qualitatively in `design-patterns.md`
§ Mobile-Unfriendly Designs; the numbers live here so both directions carry one.

### Internal distribution

| Condition | Severity |
|---|---|
| One column or child absorbs > 40% of a container's width without needing it | HIGH |
| Any element sized by the LEFTOVER whose content has a known maximum | HIGH. Flag the mechanism, not just the pixels |

The second row generalises. `margin-right: auto` on a field and an unsized column in a
`table-layout: fixed` are the same bug: a box whose size is whatever is left over. It looks
deliberate at the width it was authored against and grows without limit at every larger
one. **Grep for the mechanism**: `margin-*: auto`, `flex: 1` beside fixed siblings, unsized
columns in a fixed table, `1fr` with no `minmax`. The SwiftUI form is `Spacer()`; see
`native-ui-patterns.md`.

### Page economy

| Condition | Severity |
|---|---|
| Same entity list rendered more than twice on one screen | HIGH |
| Any single section > 40% of total page height and not the primary read | HIGH |
| Page > 2x viewport height with zero collapsed or disclosed sections | MEDIUM |
| Reference or administrative content expanded by default above the primary task | MEDIUM |

Ask what the operator came for and whether it is above the fold. On the page above they
came for the channel figures, and 45% of the document was a registry listing the same
channels a third time.

**A collapse must never hide an alert.** Fault warnings, destructive-action confirmations
and anything time-critical stay outside the fold. A disclosure that hides a fault is worse
than the scroll it saved.

### Copy economy

| Condition | Severity |
|---|---|
| Any visible paragraph > 30 words in a control surface (dashboard, settings, form) | MEDIUM, or HIGH at three or more |
| Explanatory prose above the primary data on first paint | MEDIUM |
| A qualifying clause that could sit behind a disclosure without loss | LOW each, MEDIUM as a pattern |

30 words is about three lines at a 35em measure. Marketing and documentation surfaces are
exempt; this is about interfaces where the words sit between an operator and their task.

**Long UI copy is accretion, not one bad writer.** Each review round that found a figure
potentially misleading answered by ADDING a clause, and no round ever removed one, because
no reviewer was scored on the total. The fix is lead-plus-disclosure, not deletion: the
qualifications were correct and hard-won, they just do not belong in front of the control.

### Action placement

| Condition | Severity |
|---|---|
| Row action > 800px from its row's identity at the review viewport | HIGH |
| Controls scoping the same object separated by > 400px of empty space | HIGH |
| Action controls inside a `<nav>` landmark that do not navigate | MEDIUM (also an accessibility finding) |
| Primary and destructive actions with no visual rank | MEDIUM |

The distances are viewport-relative in spirit: what matters is whether a person can hold
the association without tracking across the screen. Report the measured distance, always.

The remediation for each row: a row action lives in the row, or in a sticky action column
that scrolls with it, never in a toolbar at the top of a long table; two controls that scope
the same object sit together, beside that object; a control inside `<nav>` that performs an
action rather than a link moves out of the landmark into the content it acts on; and the primary action reads
as primary (filled, first) while the destructive one reads as destructive (outlined or red,
last, with a confirmation only when the loss is real).

## How to measure

Do not eyeball this. Run it, and quote the numbers in the finding. A density claim without
geometry is exactly the "the layout feels empty" note that gets dismissed as taste, which
is how this class survived review in the first place. A screenshot is never geometry
evidence (`confidence-and-evidence.md`).

```js
// Viewport utilisation and page economy
const main = document.querySelector('main') || document.body;
const used = main.getBoundingClientRect().width;
({
  utilisation: `${Math.round((used / innerWidth) * 100)}%`,
  unused: innerWidth - used,
  pageHeight: document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
  screens: +(document.documentElement.scrollHeight / innerHeight).toFixed(1),
  disclosures: document.querySelectorAll('details').length,
});
```

```js
// Action distance: every row action against its row's identity
[...document.querySelectorAll('tr')].flatMap((tr) => {
  const id = tr.querySelector('th, td:first-child');
  const act = tr.querySelector('button, a.btn, [type=submit]');
  if (!id || !act) return [];
  return [{
    row: id.textContent.trim().slice(0, 20),
    gap: Math.round(act.getBoundingClientRect().x - id.getBoundingClientRect().x),
  }];
});
```

```js
// Copy economy: visible paragraphs by word count, disclosures excluded
[...document.querySelectorAll('p')]
  .filter((p) => !p.closest('details') && p.offsetParent !== null)
  .map((p) => ({ words: p.textContent.trim().split(/\s+/).length }))
  .filter((p) => p.words > 30)
  .sort((a, b) => b.words - a.words);
```

### Apple surfaces

The recipes above are DOM scripts and do not exist on a native surface. The equivalents,
in the order you should reach for them:

```swift
// XCUITest: frames of the real thing, at the real size. The strongest evidence available.
let win  = app.windows.firstMatch.frame                    // the window, not UIScreen
let table = app.tables["ledger"].frame
let util  = table.width / win.width                        // viewport utilisation
let row   = app.tables["ledger"].cells.element(boundBy: 0)
let id    = row.staticTexts["realm-name"].frame
let act   = row.buttons["refresh"].frame
let gap   = act.minX - id.maxX                             // action distance, in points
```

```text
// Accessibility hierarchy snapshot: no test target needed, and it carries frames.
// Xcode > Debug > View Debugging > Capture View Hierarchy, or `po app.debugDescription`
// in an XCUITest, or Accessibility Inspector's element frames on a running app.
// Read: each element's frame, its parent's frame, and the unused remainder.
```

**Arithmetic from source literals, which needs no device at all.** This is the third
acceptable evidence form in `confidence-and-evidence.md`, it works on any surface, and it is
the only one a `Read`-only reviewer has. Quote the literals and show the subtraction:

```swift
HStack { Text(label).frame(width: 120); Spacer(); Text(value) }
    .frame(maxWidth: 900)
// 900 - 120 = 780pt of leftover assigned to a value whose longest form is 9 characters.
// Quote both literals in the finding. That is a measurement, and it grades MEDIUM or HIGH.
```

The rule that follows: **a native density finding is a taste note only when no literal is
available to do arithmetic on.** Where the frame widths, the maximum, and the content's
known maximum length are all in the source, the finding carries a number and grades like
any other. The iPad question in `native-ui-patterns.md` calls itself the single
highest-value check and grades its findings HIGH; source-literal arithmetic is how it gets
there without a device.

None of these run inside the deterministic scanner, which reads one file as text and has no
layout engine. Density is an agent dimension: the DOM and XCUITest recipes need a runtime,
the hierarchy snapshot needs a running app, and only the source-literal arithmetic is
reachable from a static read. Per the not-assessed rule, a static scan reports density as
not assessed rather than clean, and an agent with no runtime says which of the three forms
it used.

## The check that generalises

For every rule here, ask the inverse of a rule you already have. The catalogue had "lines
longer than 75ch" and no minimum density; "text clipped" and no "space unused"; "controls
overlapping" and no "controls too far apart".

**A one-directional rule catches one direction of failure.** When adding a threshold to any
rubric, write the opposite one at the same time, or record why it does not apply.

This file failed its own check until 2.1.0: § Viewport utilisation measured only the
too-little-content direction, at the widest viewport, while the overflow direction lived in
another file with no numbers. Both directions now sit in the same table. The remaining
inverses, recorded rather than left implicit:

| Threshold here | Its inverse | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Viewport under-use at the widest width | Overflow at 320-390px | Now in the same table |
| Page more than 2x viewport height with nothing collapsed | A page that hides the primary task behind a disclosure | Covered by "a collapse must never hide an alert", generalised: never fold what the operator came for |
| Paragraph over 30 words in a control surface | A control surface with no explanation where one is genuinely needed | **Deliberately not a threshold.** A missing explanation is a content finding, not a density one, and counting absent words produces noise |
| Row action more than 800px from its row identity | Controls packed too tightly to hit | Covered by the tap-target minimum in `design-patterns.md` § Mobile-Unfriendly Designs (24x24 CSS px, WCAG 2.5.8) |
