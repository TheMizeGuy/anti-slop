# Banned Words

Words whose frequency in published text jumped after 2022, and which corpus work since has repeatedly named as overrepresented in generated prose. `delve` is the most-studied case and the one currently receding fastest, which is a reminder that the list is a snapshot rather than a law.

The list is not the evidence. `empirical-rankings.md` carries the hand-audited corpus numbers, including the finding that several of the loudest-looking words here are almost never what a reader actually cites.

## Three tiers, and what each one asks of you

Not every word in this file is a tell, and treating them all as one was the mistake this file used to make. The scanner's two lists in `scripts/lib/rules.mjs` (`BANNED_WORDS` and `LOW_CONFIDENCE_WORDS`) are the source of truth for the first two tiers, and `self-check.md` § Vocabulary mirrors the same split.

| Tier | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-hit tells** | One occurrence in user-facing prose is a finding | Write the plain word instead |
| **Cluster tells** | Ordinary words with an inflated sense; a lone hit is the writer's prose, two or more in one document is the tell | Let one pass; thin them out when they gather |
| **Plain-word preferences** | Ordinary English that also has an inflated use. Not a tell in either tier, never flagged by the scanner, and never reported by a reviewer | Prefer the plain word when it says the same thing; keep the word when it is the precise one |

The third tier is the largest, and it exists to say what not to do as much as what to do: a sentence that uses one of those words is not a finding, and a sentence rewritten to dodge one is worse than the original.

**Technical context caveat:** Many words below are standard terms in their domains. "Aggregate" in SQL and pandas, "benchmark" in testing and ML, "calibrate" in ML and instrumentation, "converge" in ML and numerical methods, "ecosystem" in npm and platform discussions, "landscape" in geography and page orientation, "ephemeral" in container storage, "synergy" in game design, "diverse" for demographic or cultural diversity. When the word is the precise term, use it. The scanner carries a context-exception table for the single-hit words most often used technically, so a `realm` in a game server or a `landscape` in a GIS tool scans clean.

**Register note:** Frequency data is based primarily on American English corpora. In British English formal prose, some words on this list (renowned, featuring) may be standard. Apply judgment for non-American registers. In academic and formal writing contexts, consult the Context Exceptions in SKILL.md before applying these bans.

**Concentration caveat:** A hand-audited Reddit corpus (see `empirical-rankings.md`) found several high-frequency "AI words" are almost never what readers actually flag: `however` / `thus` / `hence` match about 6% of posts but are cited as a tell 0% of the time; the same holds for `nuanced`, `when it comes to`, `utilize`, `navigate`, `comprehensive`, and `robust`. Those are the cluster tier. One `delve` is the writer's prose; six fancy verbs in one paragraph is slop. The scanner reflects this: a cluster-tier word does not lower the score on a single hit.

## Single-hit tells

The scanner flags these on one occurrence in user-facing prose, at medium severity, Pattern smell. Each has a plain word that says the same thing.

| Banned | Use Instead |
|--------|-------------|
| `delve` / `delving` | dig into, examine, look at |
| `elevate` | raise, improve |
| `embark` | start, begin |
| `unveil` / `unveiling` | show, reveal, announce |
| `showcase` / `showcasing` | show, display, present |
| `spearhead` | lead |
| `orchestrate` | arrange, coordinate, run (the Kubernetes and workflow-engine senses are excused) |
| `synergize` | work together |
| `galvanize` | motivate, push, spark |
| `transcend` | go beyond, surpass |
| `pivotal` | important, key (or say why it matters) |
| `cutting-edge` | new, modern, latest |
| `groundbreaking` | new (or describe what it broke) |
| `transformative` | big, major (or describe the change) |
| `unprecedented` | new, first, rare |
| `unparalleled` | best, top, unique |
| `multifaceted` | complex, varied (or name the facets) |
| `bustling` | busy, active |
| `enchanting` | appealing, attractive (the game-item sense is excused) |
| `landscape` (metaphorical) | name the specific field, market, or area |
| `tapestry` (metaphorical) | mix, combination (or describe specifically) |
| `synergy` | cooperation, combined effect (or describe it) |
| `testament` | proof, evidence, sign |
| `interplay` | interaction, relationship, connection |
| `paradigm` | model, approach, pattern (the programming-paradigm sense is excused) |
| `intersection` (metaphorical) | overlap, meeting point |
| `gossamer` | thin, delicate, fine |
| `iridescent` | shimmering (or describe the specific colors) |
| `luminous` | bright, glowing, lit |
| `ephemeral` | brief, short-lived, fleeting (the container and cache senses are excused) |
| `ethereal` | light, airy, delicate |
| `enigmatic` | mysterious, puzzling |

The last six are the fiction register's defaults; § Creative Writing below says why they count on sight there.

## Cluster tells

Ordinary words with an inflated sense. The scanner flags them at low severity, Pattern smell, only when two or more appear in one document; a lone hit is clean. When they gather, thin them out rather than replacing every one.

| Word | Plain alternative |
|------|-------------------|
| `utilize` / `utilizing` | use |
| `leverage` / `leveraging` | use |
| `harness` / `harnessing` | use, apply (the testing and wiring senses are excused) |
| `streamline` | simplify, speed up |
| `foster` / `fostering` | encourage, support |
| `facilitate` | help, enable |
| `cultivate` | build, grow, develop |
| `empower` / `empowering` | enable, give power to |
| `navigate` (metaphorical) | handle, deal with, work through |
| `comprehensive` | full, complete, thorough (fine in "comprehensive test coverage") |
| `robust` | strong, solid, reliable (fine in statistics and testing) |
| `nuanced` | subtle, complex, layered |
| `meticulous` | careful, precise, detailed |
| `seamless` | smooth, easy (the texture and tile senses are excused) |
| `holistic` | whole, complete, full |
| `myriad` | many |
| `plethora` | many, plenty |
| `paramount` | most important, top priority |
| `intricate` | complex, detailed |
| `profound` | deep, serious, major |
| `vibrant` | lively, active, bright (fine for colour and display work) |
| `captivating` | interesting, engaging (the audience-retention sense is excused) |
| `realm` | field, area, domain (the game-server sense is excused) |

## Plain-word preferences (not tells)

Everything below is ordinary English. Each word also has an inflated or reflexive use that generated prose reaches for, which is the only reason it is listed. **None of these is a finding.** The scanner does not match them, the self-check does not ask about them, and a reviewer does not report them. The guidance is one-directional: when you are choosing a word, prefer the plain one if it says the same thing; when the listed word is the precise one, or the plain word would change the meaning, keep it.

A note on what was removed. Earlier versions of this file listed `validate`, `optimize`, `mitigate`, `aggregate`, `interpret`, `differentiate`, `correlate`, `quantify`, `benchmark`, `align`, `reconcile`, `elaborate`, `deliberate`, `formulate`, `ascertain`, `tailor`, `framework` and a dozen more as words to avoid. They are the precise term in software, statistics, law, or plain business English, their suggested replacements changed the meaning, and no corpus has ever ranked them as a tell. They are gone, and a reviewer who flags one is applying a rule this plugin no longer has.

|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `crucial` | important, key (or say why) |
| `impactful` | effective, strong (or describe the impact) |
| `overarching` | broad, main, overall |
| `innovative` | new (or describe the innovation) |
| `indispensable` | essential, needed, required |
| `unwavering` | steady, firm, constant |
| `invaluable` | very useful, essential |

| the project, effort, attempt | `endeavor` |
| the connection, link, center | `nexus` |
| the test, challenge | `crucible` |
| the trigger, spark, cause | `catalyst` (a term in chemistry) |
| the puzzle, mystery | `enigma` |

### Adverbs that usually add nothing

Delete these in polished expository prose when the sentence says the same thing without them. In conversational writing `just` and `actually` are ordinary; `significantly` is a term in statistics; `effectively` meaning "in effect" stays.

| Usually deletable |
|-------------------|
| `really`, `just`, `literally`, `genuinely`, `honestly`, `simply`, `actually` |
| `deeply`, `truly`, `fundamentally`, `inherently`, `inevitably` |
| `interestingly`, `importantly`, `crucially`, `impressively`, `notably` |
| `effectively`, `strategically`, `comprehensively`, `intricately`, `essentially` |
| `significantly`, `remarkably`, `undeniably`, `undoubtedly`, `arguably`, `admittedly`, `increasingly` |

### Promotional language

Words that read like a press release or travel brochure. Drop or replace in functional writing; in marketing copy the register decides.

| Prefer plain | When the plain word says the same thing |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `nestled` | located, sits |
| `thriving` | active, growing, busy |
| `renowned` | known, well-known, famous |
| `featuring` | with, including, has |
| `timeless` | lasting, classic |
| `awe-inspiring` / `breathtaking` | impressive, striking |
| `exquisite` | fine, beautiful, detailed |
| `uncharted` | new, unexplored |
| `boundless` | vast, unlimited, wide |
| `marveling` | impressed by, surprised by |

### Compound modifiers

Hyphenated compounds generated prose stacks in front of nouns. `data-driven` and `results-driven` are ordinary in business and engineering writing; the tell is two or three of these in one paragraph.

| Prefer plain | When the plain word says the same thing |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `ever-evolving` / `ever-changing` | changing |
| `ever-expanding` | growing |
| `ever-competitive` | competitive |
| `hyper-connected` | connected |
| `fast-paced` | quick, busy |
| `game-changing` | big, important (or say what changed) |
| `thought-provoking` | interesting (or say what it provokes) |
| `forward-thinking` | modern, progressive |
| `results-driven` | effective, focused |
| `data-driven` | based on data |

### Fancy substitutes for "is" and "has"

Generated prose avoids simple linking verbs. Use "is" and "has" when they are the right words. Every row below applies only when the verb means plain "is" or "has": "the column represents the total" (means "stands for"), "the proxy operates as a cache" (describes a role), and "the plan features three tiers" (marketing) are the verb doing real work.

| Prefer plain | Instead of |
|--------------|-----------|
| is | `serves as`, `stands as`, `constitutes`, `functions as`, `operates as` |
| is | `represents`, `marks` (when either means "is") |
| has | `features`, `offers`, `boasts` |

## The 2026 Plain-Word Register

Everything above this section describes the 2024 tell: an inflated word standing in for a plain one, `delve` for "look at". The 2026 tell inverts it. Plain, short, Anglo-Saxon words are used metaphorically to manufacture weight: `quietly`, `shift`, `matters`, `shape`, `land`, `real`, `earn`, `the work`, `hold`, `pull`, `compound`, `signal`, `built different`. "Quietly building the future." "Decisions compound." "Earn the right to your reader's attention."

None of these words is bannable, and none of them is on any list in this file. Every one is ordinary English doing an ordinary job most of the time, and a word-level ban would fire on most correctly written prose. The tell is the **metaphorical collocation**, and only when several land in one passage. Treat it exactly as the cluster tier is treated: a single hit is the writer's prose.

The scanner reflects that. `plain-aiism-collocation` matches the collocations only (`quietly building`, `why this matters`, `earn the right to`, `decisions compound`, `built different`, `hold space`, `do the work`), at low severity and only at two or more in one document. The bare words are deliberately absent from `BANNED_WORDS` and must stay absent.

The fix is the same as everywhere else in this file: say the concrete thing. "Decisions compound" means "the second decision is cheaper because of the first"; write that instead.

## Creative Writing

Words generated fiction overuses in narrative and descriptive writing. Six of them (`gossamer`, `iridescent`, `luminous`, `ephemeral`, `ethereal`, `enigmatic`) are single-hit tells in the scanner because they arrive as a set; the rest are preferences. In fiction the register decides: a story told in a lush voice may use any of these on purpose, and a lone `palpable` is the author's word. The tell is the stock set arriving together where nothing specific was seen.

| Prefer a specific, surprising detail | Instead of |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| strong, obvious, thick | `palpable` |
| bright, dazzling, colorful | `resplendent` |
| gut-level, raw, physical | `visceral` |
| name the thing | `ineffable` |
| playful, odd, quirky | `whimsical` |
| sad, touching, sharp | `poignant` |
| suggestive, reminiscent | `evocative` |
| gripping, absorbing | `riveting`, `spellbinding` |
| tempting, teasing | `tantalizing` |

Also avoid: characters sighing, taking deep breaths, or staring out windows as default emotional beats. Eyes should not constantly "glisten," "sparkle," or "widen." Find specific, unexpected actions instead.
